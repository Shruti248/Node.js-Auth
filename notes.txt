COOKIES
-Store data in a user's browser

JSON WEB TOKENS
User logs in the web form and sends a request to the server(say credentials like email passwords)
The server then checks the credentials against those stored in the db for that user
Now , if they are correct -- the server then creates a json web token for that user , and sends it back to the browser where it is stored as a cookie
jwt contains the encoded data about that user to identify them
So as long as they have this jwt in the cookie , then they are considered logged in and authenticated
Now the user has this jwt , stored in the cookie in the web browser
REMEMBER : Cookies are sent to the server by the browser for every request they make
So when the server gets the token from the cookie in the request , tehy can verify it and decode it to identify the user...
Now if it is verifed to be the valid token , user can be seen logged in by the server and the server can decide to show the user protected data or pages which require the user to be authenticated 
if the token is not valid -- server can send errors or direct them to the login page or something
